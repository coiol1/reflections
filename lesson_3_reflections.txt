When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    Good for collaborating with others across multiple computers. Also good for
    backup purposes in case your local computer gets corrupted or something
    happens.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    With multiple people working on different pieces, it could get messy to have
    Git stay up to date at all times.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks are used to copy someone else's repository when you don't have
    permission to write to it, and make it easier to suggest changes. Clones
    copy the repository, but can't suggest changes easily. Clones might be
    useful if you're just using something as a base and planning to modify it
    heavily. Branches are on the local repository and let you try different
    changes out before merging them.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    You can work on it without having internet access.
